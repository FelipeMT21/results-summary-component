## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned a lot about how to use flexbox, grid, and lists, and I understand the best way to choose between them.

```html
<li class="desc desc-red"><img src="./assets/images/icon-reaction.svg" alt="icon-reaction" height="15"> Reaction</li>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
background: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
}
```

### Continued development

To further enhance my design skills, I plan on delving deeper into Grid and Flexbox in order to gain a better understanding of these tools and use them more fluidly. This will expand my possibilities for creation and allow me to design more complex and sophisticated layouts.

### Useful resources

- [W3Sschools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - "This site helped me create buttons on many forms exactly the way I wanted."
- [Developer Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - This is an amazing article that helped me explore various possibilities to solve my challenge. I would recommend it to anyone who is still learning this concept.
